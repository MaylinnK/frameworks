# Frameworks

## Assignment
I made this repository with the goal to help new front-end developers understand the basics of frameworks. As someone who did not receive this explanation when starting with frameworks, it was very difficult to know what I was doing and it wouldve been a great help if it were a little easier to find simple articles about them.  

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to either the React or Vue project.
3. Run the server.

## Documentation
As this repository is solely meant to explain frameworks, the wiki is the most important part of it. You can use the code as preview, but it is all shown in the wiki as well, including explanations of the steps. I recommend to follow along with the steps instead of just copying it from the repo. Read the wiki [here](https://github.com/MaylinnK/frameworks/wiki)
